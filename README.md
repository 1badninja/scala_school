This is Scala School- a set of lessons covering the Scala programming language.

We use [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to generate the site. In order to build it, you must first install it:

	$ gem install jekyll
	
should do. Now, build the site with `make`. This will create a copy of the lessons in the `_site` folder.
