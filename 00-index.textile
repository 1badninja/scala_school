h1. Overview

We think it makes the most sense to approach teaching Scala not as if
it's an improved Java but as a new language. Experience in Java is not
expected. Focus will be around the interpreter and the
object-functional style as well as the style of programming we do
here. An emphasis will be placed on maintainability, clarity of
expression, and leveraging the type system.


A rough syllabus

# values, functions, classes, methods, inheritance, try-catch-finally. expression-oriented programming
# traits, case classes, objects, packages, apply, update, Functions are Objects (uniform access principle)
# higher-order functions, pattern matching, unapply, seq
# the object model, relationship between classes and traits, linearization, overriding
# functional combinators, for-comprehensions, Options
# classes that extend Function, manifests, simple implicits
# types: inference: show Hindley-Milner, give examples. doesn't devolve into Any everywhere.
# types: parametrization, view bounds, rigid, covariant, contravariant, structural types
# types: higher kinded types, type classes, existential.
